    Massaria commonly affects London Plane trees. A<a href="http://www.londontreereports-surveys.co.uk/Fungus/Massaria-Disease-of-Plane.html"> tree consultant explains</a>, "The disease always attacks the upper side of the branch and is difficult to spot from the ground for this reason. In the early stages a long pink brown strip can be seen, followed by brown and then a black strip with spores." A major cause of massaria is drought stress.
    <br />
    <br />
    The tree was most recently inspected in July 2017 and November 2015, and had been pruned in August 2017. According to the Parks Department data, 31 people were injured by falling trees or branches between 2011 and 2015. In 2017, a <a href="http://gothamist.com/2017/09/13/central_park_tree_lawsuit.php#photo-1">3,000-pound, 75-foot elm tree fell in Central Park</a>, fracturing the skull of a two-year-old boy and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/News/mother-hit-giant-tree-lives-forever-altered/story?id=53358418">fracturing his mother's neck</a> (her two other sons, a baby strapped to her chest and a four-year-old were uninjured). The Central Park Conservancy maintains the trees in Central Park.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Update</b>: The Parks Department says that 23 people have been injured from falling tree branches in city parks from 2016 through May 20, 2019. There have been 11 incidents in Manhattan, seven in Queens, three in Brooklyn, one in the Bronx and one on Staten Island.

The event, which will take place in DUMBO (Pac-Brooklyn?) this July 18th, is a live action recreation of the old arcade fave.</p>

<blockquote>Pac-Manhattan is a large-scale urban game that utilizes the New York City grid to recreate the 1980's video game sensation Pac-Man. This analog version of Pac-man is being developed in <a href="http://gamecenter.nyu.edu/pac-manhattan/">NYU's Interactive Telecommunications graduate program</a>, in order to explore what happens when games are removed from their 'little world' of tabletops, televisions and computers and placed in the larger 'real world' of street corners, and cities.

<p>A player dressed as Pac-man will run around while attempting to collect all of the virtual 'dots' that run the length of the streets. Four players dressed as the ghosts Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Clyde will attempt to catch Pac-man before all of the dots are collected. </p>

<p>Using cell-phone contact, Wi-Fi internet connections, and custom software designed by the Pac-Manhattan team, Pac-man and the ghosts will be tracked from a central location and their progress will be broadcast over the internet for viewers from around the world.</blockquote></p>

<p>NYU Game Center Director (and Pac-Manhattan creator) Frank Lantz notes that "Pac-Manhattan brings an extreme physicality to the game. Not just in terms of the athletic skill and nontrivial endurance required, but also in the way that the physical details of the urban environment affect the gameplay. Traffic, pedestrians, lines of sight, and points of access&#8212;all the complicated and arbitrary concreteness of the world&#8212;these things that are abstracted out of the platonic geometry of the Pac-Man maze become the endlessly surprising contours of PacManhattan&#8217;s unpredictable terrain."</p>
